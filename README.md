# Case studies of Survival Analysis for Predictive Maintenance data sets

The repository contains two publicaly available datasets used for Predictive maintenance in the Manufacturing.

1. *Predictive Maintenance Modelling Guide Data Sets* - collection of several csv files used for "Predictive Maintenance Modelling Guide". The Experiment along the data set can be found at offcial Microsoft AI Gallery portal (https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Predictive-Maintenance-Modelling-Guide-Data-Sets-1).

2. *Turbofan engine degradation simulation data set* - Run - to -failure data set engine degradation owned by NASA. The dataset can be found at https://data.nasa.gov/Aerospace/Turbofan-engine-degradation-simulation-data-set/vrks-gjie.
